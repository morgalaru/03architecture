There was this one time that I thought it'd 
be a really great idea to light a napkin on  

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.280
fire. I was thinking it'd be like when you light 
a paper on fire and the flame just kind of slowly  

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:22.120
spreads across the paper and then you just blow 
it out when you're done. So I got the napkin and  

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.520
I got a lighter--I was in my kitchen--and I Iight 
it on fire and then of course the flames--it's a  

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.520
napkin, it's not a piece of paper. The flame 
goes woosh and I sit there staring at it like  

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.120
oh--panicking and my sister goes, "Run! Run to 
the sink!" So I go and I drop the napkin in the  

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.880
sink and I spray it with water because I thought I 
was going to burn the house down and then it hurt  

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.000
pretty bad cause it was like burning my whole hand 
off cause I was just holding onto the napkin. umm,  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.920
but luckily I did not burn the house down and 
you live and you learn. You do stupid things  

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.280
when you're like 15, but usually it turns out 
just fine. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
